Given an integer array length n
Please use merge sort to sort in Ascending order the print in order

Keywords: Temp array, recursion, remaining elements.

Things to remember:
1. Recursion first, both parts
2. Three pointers, i for left side of array, j right side, k temp array.
3. Condition: i<=mid && j<=r.
4. If left/right side runs out of values to compare, move all remaining elements of q into temp.
*5. Must move from temp array back to original array. for(int i = l, j =0; i<=r; i++, j++)
6. Need an "else" to cover all remaining possible conditions

Input
line 1: number

Range
1<=n<=100000
