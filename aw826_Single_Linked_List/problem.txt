Implement a single linkedlist. It supports 3 operations:
1. Insert a number at the head of the list.
2. delete the number after kth.
3. Insert the number after kth.

Things to remember:
1. Do init() before loop in main.
2. Kth insertion, plug in k-1;
3. When trying to delete index, keep in mind if the index is at the head.
    if(k == 0) {
        head = ne[head];
    }
4. Iterating through linked list:
    for(int i = head; i != -1; i = ne[i]) {
            cout<<e[i]<<" ";
        }
5. Difference between inserting at index k and at head:
    Head has no ne[k], just directly replace with head.
6. Add and remove at k-1

Input
1. H x, insert a number at the head
2. D k, delete the number after kth
3. I k x, insert a number x after kth. k>0

output
the numbers of the list

1<=N<=100000

Sample input:
10
H 9
I 1 1
D 1
D 0
H 6
I 3 6
I 4 5
I 4 5
I 3 4
D 6

Sample output:
6 4 6 5
