Given an array with length n
with m operations, each operation contains l, r, c, means add c in the range [l, r]
printout the new array

Notes:
1. Construct a difference array, assume array s is prefix summation of array a, then a is the "DIFFERENCE ARRAY" of the s array.
   Here when you construct, when you get array passed in, assume it is summation array, and for each index subtract by prev index.
2. Insert function. Takes in l, r indexes and c. arr[l]+=c, arr[r+1]-=c.
3. Construct summation array, b[i]+=b[i-1];

Input
n, m
array
l, r, c

output
final array

Range
1<=n, m <=100000,
1<=l<=r<=n,
-1000 <=c <=1000
-1000 <= element <=1000

Input
6 3
1 2 2 1 2 1
1 3 1
3 5 1
1 6 1

Output
3 4 5 3 4 2
