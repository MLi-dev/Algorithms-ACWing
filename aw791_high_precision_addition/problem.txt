Given two positive Integer, calculate the sum

Things to Remember:
1. For loop based on which vector has the bigger size (Need "if" condition for main checking sizes).
2. vector<int> add() function needs int t. Use t keep track of A[i] + B[i].
    push into vector(t&10);
    t/=10;
3. At end of for loop, check if t != 0, then push 1 into vector.
