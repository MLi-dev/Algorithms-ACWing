Farmer knows the cows position and wants to catch it

They are on a x-axis, farmer is at N and cow is at K

Farmer can move to x-1 or x+1 or 2x, all cost him 1 minute

cow is not moving

How long it will take farmer to catch the cow?

Things to Remember:
1. If farmer at cow position, return current distance.
2. Initialize all position -1. Set dist[farmer's position] = 0.
3. t+1, 2*t check <N, t-1>=0, dist[element] == -1 (not visited). Then put in queue, inc distance.
