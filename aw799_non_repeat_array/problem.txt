Given an array of integer with length n, find the longest subarray that doesn't have repeated number


Things to remember: Return int resp for longest length of non-repeating array.
1. Need 2 arrays a[N] and cnt[N], cnt[N] tracks number of times element occurs.
2. General Template:
    for(int i = 0, j = 0; i<n; i++) {
           //Do something if needed for i. In this problem, cnt[a[i]]++;
            while(j<=i && check(i, j)) { //Check function here is cnt[a[i]]>1
            //Do something before you move the j pointer. Ex: In this problem, update count by cnt[a[j]]--;
            j++
            }
        }
3. resp max(resp, i-j+1);

Input:
n
n integers

Output:
the longest length of non repeat subarray

Range:
1<=n<=10^5

Sample input:
5
1 2 2 3 5

Sample Output:
3
