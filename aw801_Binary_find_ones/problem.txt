Given an array length n, find out ones within each element when it is in binary (0/1)


Things to Remember:
1. lowBit(int x) returns x&-x;
2. while(x) { <-- x isn't 0.
   x-= lowBit(x)
   cnt++;
   }

Input
n
n integers

output
numbers of ones

Range
1<=n<=100000

Input sample
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output sample
1 1 2 1 2
